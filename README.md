# hello-world
This is the beginning of it all

I created this Git-hub account to learn how to code on software for misting rooms, and creating grow rooms for plants, fungi, and other species. I want to automate the misting process, temperature, oxygen/carbon dioxide, and air flow. I plan o also include web cam capabilities, with adequite security features to keep the webcam secure. I wish to learn how progaming a program like this is done. 
This is my goal. I need to learn how to code, how to program, and how to impliment that program into a computer.

This is my goal with this account. I am a beginner programmer, but I have some experience.
