# hello-world
This is the beginning of it all

I created this Git-hub account to learn how to code on software for misting rooms, and creating grow rooms for plants, fungi, and other species. I want to automate the misting process, and learn how it is done. 
This is my goal. I need to learn how to code, how to program, and how to impliment that program into a computer.

This is my goal with this account. I am a beginner programmer, but I have some experience.
